              Perki church services are held twice a month - on Saturday of the
              second week by Pastor Titus Christianto and on the fourth week by
              Pastor John Kusuma. The service begins with a private quiet time,
              followed by singing hymns together accompanied by a piano. In the
              main part of the service, the serving pastor will expound on the
              Word of God. After the sermon, the congregation is given the
              opportunity to pray privately and respond to the Word. The service
              ends with the giving of offerings, intercessory prayer, sending
              out, quiet time and announcements.{" "}

              Every three months we hold Holy Communion at the end of the
              service. Everyone who has received the Lord Jesus as Savior and
              awaits His second coming by faith is welcome to partake. (1
              Corinthians 11:28).

            Our Big Group Bible Study is a joint Bible Study activity held on
            the first, third and fifth week (if applicable) of each month. The
            service is led by the Fellowship Committee and the seating position
            is made around a large table. At the beginning of the service, the
            congregation is given the opportunity to choose a hymn to sing
            together or share their life experiences with God. Through this
            activity, fellowship members are expected to learn to witness, get
            to know each other more deeply and also love. After the word prayer,
            the caretaker on duty will lead the exposition of God&apos;s Word
            and the congregation is allowed to discuss or ask questions at the
            end of the reflection. The service then ends with prayer, offerings
            and announcements.

Four times I practiced ministry (assigned by SAAT) located in Eastern Indonesia, namely in Palu, Bali, Papua, and Makassar. But this year it feels like the direction of the wind of ministry has changed and pushed my ministry heart to the West. This is where I am anchored, at FeG Immanuel Berlin \n I completed my bachelor's degree in Theology at Southeast Asia Bible Seminary in 2019 and continued my post-graduate program in 2020. In my ministry practice, I served for one year at Kalam Kudus Church in Makassar. My ministry is also fully supported by my loving family. My father is a doctor and my mother is a teacher. I am the third of three children, where my older siblings also serve as doctors and servants of God. They also fully support my ministry in this place.",
